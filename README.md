# Virtual Assistant

This project is a browser-based virtual assistant that uses speech recognition and speech synthesis to interact with users. It listens to voice commands, processes them, and performs tasks such as:

#### Greeting the User: Based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening).

Executing Commands: Opens websites like YouTube, Google, Facebook, or Instagram on request.

Providing Information: Tells the current time or date.

Search Functionality: For unrecognized commands, it searches the internet and opens the results in a new tab.

Error Handling: Provides feedback when speech recognition fails.

The project utilizes Web APIs like SpeechSynthesisUtterance for speech output and SpeechRecognition for voice input. It is designed for interactive user experiences and can be expanded with additional commands and features.
