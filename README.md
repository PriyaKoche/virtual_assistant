# Virtual Assistant
This project is a simple virtual assistant that uses speech recognition and speech synthesis. It can greet you, open websites, and tell you the current time and date based on voice commands.

## Features
- Speech Recognition: Recognizes your voice commands and converts them into text.
- Speech Synthesis: Speaks back to you in Hindi or English.
- Voice Commands: You can ask it to open websites like YouTube, Google, Facebook, Instagram, or open a calculator. You can also ask for the current time and date.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For the basic structure of the page.
- CSS: For styling the page (optional, depending on your design).
- JavaScript: For speech recognition and synthesis.
- SpeechRecognition API: To recognize speech commands.
- SpeechSynthesis API: To speak back the responses.

## How It Works
- Start Voice Recognition: Click the button to start the voice recognition process.
- Give Voice Command: Say commands like "open YouTube", "open Google", "what’s the time", or "who are you".
- Assistant Responds: The assistant will speak back the response and take action based on your command (e.g., opening a website or telling the time).
  
## Example Commands
